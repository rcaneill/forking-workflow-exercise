800 grams or 1.75 kg of potatoes (about two large-sized potatoes)
600 grams or 1.3 kg fresh spinach
1/3 cup or about half a small white onion, finely chopped
4 cloves of garlic, finely minced
2 tablespoons of olive oil
fine sea salt, to taste
ground black pepper, to taste
queso fresco, for topping (you could sub with feta if desired)
refried beans, as side dish
grilled chiles, as an optional side dish
corn tortillas

Instruction: 
Prepare any side dish first as the tacos are ready in a short amount of time. Next throughly rinse the spinach to remove any and all dirt that may be trapped on the stems. Also if the stems are really long, cut most of it off. Roughly chop the spinach and set aside. Now throughly clean the potatoes and peel them too. Cut the potato into very small bite-size pieces at roughly the same size — this is important so that the potato doesn’t rip the tortilla.

Heat the oil in a very large pan, once hot add the potatoes and fry for a few minutes, stirring often to prevent burning. Next add onion and sauté until soft and translucent, then add the minced garlic, and a large pinch of sea salt. Continue to cook until the potatoes are soft and cooked through — if needed you can add a couple of tablespoons of water to the pan to prevent the potatoes from burning. Now add the roughly chopped spinach to the pan and gently stir the ingredients. Sprinkle some ground black pepper over the ingredients and stir. Continue to cook until the spinach has just begun to wilt. Additionally you may need to add the spinach in a couple of batches as it takes up a large space. Taste and if needed add more salt and/or black pepper.

Warm the corn tortillas up and scoop a couple of tablespoons into each tortilla, sprinkle some crumbled queso fresco over each taco; and if desired top with a couple of pieces of purple onion. Serve from 3 to 4 tacos per person and with side dishes of your choice. Enjoy!
